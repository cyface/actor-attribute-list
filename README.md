Inspired by [Actor Attribute Lists](https://github.com/relick/FoundryVTT-Actor-Attribute-Lists) Module by relick which was unfortunately abandoned.

## Installation

1. Open the Add-on Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup dialog.
2. Click Install Module and search for "5e Actor Attributes", or use the following manifest URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mybigfriendjo/5e-actor-attributes/main/module.json`
3. Install the module and activate it for your World using the checkbox in the 'Manage Modules' Dialog.

## Usage

The module adds a new Header Button to the Actor Sheet called "Show Attributes".

Clicking it opens a new Window with all Attributes of the Actor Sheet in a table. The table is divided into sections for each type of attribute (Skills, Abilities, Attributes, etc).

From there you can copy the Attribute Names for use in Text and Descriptions.
